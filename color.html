<p><b>"House Style" Notes (aka I am NOT just using a fake film plugin)</b><br />
My grade pipeline is based on the work done by Steve Yedlin, namely his <a href="https://www.yedlin.net/DisplayPrepDemo/DispPrepDemoFollowup.html">display prep demo</a>, although where I disagree 
  is in perfect film replication as the final goal as I personally see that being hollowly driven by nostalgia and cheap legitimacy. I prefer to use it only as a reference point for the "color science" 
 part of the image while leaving grain, halation and gate weave aside but those attributes can be added quite easily upon request as well. <br /><br />

The recipe I use to get to a celluloid color science is decidedly NOT a plugin like Dehancer, FilmBox, Cineprint etc. Those have driven an ugly trend in digital color grading that looks to
  mimic all of the most obvious elements of film while missing the most elusive parts of the look. Their color science looks more akin to simple cool + warm tone curves based on film stocks opposed to a 
  proper look 3D transform the way Yedlin lays out in the video above. The pipeline I use is built around Matthias Stoopman's transform inspired by Yedlin's work. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piXGuc1twio">Here it is compared with the Kodak 5219
   500t stock that it was based on.</a> And here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py5p_V3N2yM">it is compared with a decent emulation by Juan Melara which results in an image more similar to the popular plugin options.</a><br /><br />
