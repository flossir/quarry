<p><b>"House Style" Notes, aka I am NOT just using Dehancer:</b><br />
My grade pipeline is based on Steve Yedlin's <a href="https://www.yedlin.net/DisplayPrepDemo/DispPrepDemoFollowup.html">display prep demo</a> although I disagree  
  with the final goal being a completely convincing film look as something too nostalgia driven. I personally prefer to use celluloid as a reference point for the "color science" 
of the image while leaving grain, halation and gate weave aside but those can be added quite easily upon request. <br /><br />

The recipe I use for celluloid color science is decidedly NOT a plugin like Dehancer, FilmBox, Cineprint etc. 
Those are good at mimicing the degrading qualities of film but their color changes look more like simple tone curves based on film stocks opposed to a proper look 3D transform the way Yedlin lays out in the video above. 
The pipeline I use is built around Matthias Stoopman's transform inspired by Yedlin's work.
