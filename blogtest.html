<br /><br /><b>An Incomplete Guide to Eating Out in Phoenix, AZ</b><br /><br />
Notes: I have a tendency towards being a hater but I try to continually make sure this hating comes from love, love for difficult things (the best gift one can give) and hate for scammers and whores (not in the sexual sense of course). So this list may be a downer and may even get messaged to people who will be upset with me but that’s understandable and I am hoping to move back to LA sometime soon anyways so hopefully if there’s any consequences to writing this I won’t have to face them. Anyways, here is a guide to eating in Phoenix, Arizona to the best of my knowledge:
<br /><br />
<b>SUSHI:</b><br /><br />
&emsp;&emsp;Beginning with a tough one. Anyone who had to spend too much time with me 2021-2023 endured screeds on Phoenix’s lack of any justifiable sushi. I would say things like the only good sushi in Phoenix is the plain nigiri to-go boxes from Sprout’s, a bit over the top of course but a necessary reaction amidst a public that accepted purple rice in their sushi as a positive thing. At this point in time Harumi was still in the smaller sports bar-ish location on 1st ave & Adams, since then they have moved directly across the street to the kind of space that a hotel restaurant one competes for the chance to work at on a season of Hell’s Kitchen would look like. Anyways, they are still serving sushi on purple rice so I won’t be trying it at the new location. I would say I find people who eat here to easily susceptible but the prices are at least normal-ish, on the other hand there is a place called Sandfish Sushi & Whiskey up in the melrose district that is not priced normal-ish. This is the one place in Phoenix I would beg anyone not to go to under any circumstances. It only exists to scam rich people, a pretty common genre of restaurant in Phoenix (Roka Akor, Buck & Rider for ex.) which is why I will be generally avoiding Scottsdale, and it may have been the most upset I’ve ever been about having paid for a meal. Which you might say “hey Parker, you’re acting pretentious about food scams yet you chose to eat at a place called Sandfish Sushi & Whiskey” and you would be right and I would be wrong, I thought it would be funny to try but even a bit meal has its limits. Just don’t go. Less unforgivable able but still unrecommended are Kaizen and Sake Haus for similar reasons (overpriced, covered in bullshit to make up for lack of skill). 
<br /><br />
&emsp;&emsp;On a more positive note Sushi Friend is solid, if I lived close by I would probably go often even. Do I have an instinct to deflate it a bit because it is very overhyped for what it is? Yes, but the prices were ok and the miso soup was very good so no need to be too harsh. Hana is good from what I remember though I haven’t been since they stopped doing byob and I remember preferring other dishes over the sushi. Places I haven’t tried include Uchi, Shin Bay, Shimogamo, Hiro and technically Across the Pond. Technically because I went with skepticism knowing it was part of the Clever Koi empire but the prices looked surprisingly normal. It was only once I sat down realized they were actually listed for 1pc of nigiri each. It felt like a fine print scam. That was combined with a service fee to help pay their employees. Not one to pay them living wages instead of tips, no, but one on top of tipping to pretend the food costs less than it does. Scammy bullshit trying to hide behind vaguely pro-worker language, I hate restaurentrpreneurs.
<br /><br />
&emsp;&emsp;The only sushi place I can thoroughly recommend going out of your way for in Phoenix, Arizona: Sushi Nakano. This restaurant is the reason for the closing date on my screeds mentioned above, some of the best sushi meals I’ve had anywhere (my sushi pedigree is not special but I have tried my way around NY, LA, a random but good place in Tokyo, etc). If you really want sushi in Phoenix honestly just stomach the trip to Ahwatukee, stomach the environment that is Ahwatukee and order at least the classics + nasu, ankimo or zuke maguro if any of those are available.
